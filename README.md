# Providing data-driven suggestions for HR

## About the Project
The main goal of this project involves analyzing data gathered by the HR department and developing a model capable of forecasting whether an employee will leave the organization. Should we be able to predict which employees are likely to leave, we may uncover the reasons behind their departures. With the considerable time and expenses tied to finding, interviewing, and hiring new employees, boosting employee retention offers clear benefits for the company. The project was organized following the PACE methodology (*Plan-Analyze-Construct-Execute*).


**used libraries**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, seaborn, pickle, xgboost.
